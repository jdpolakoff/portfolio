      <h4>The Party's Over At Neptune Marina</h4>
      MARINA DEL REY, Calif. -- As the sun hung high over Marina del Rey on a recent Saturday afternoon, a procession of swimsuit-clad mourners gathered poolside for a marathon party fueled by jubilee and sadness — a jazz funeral for the marina’s oldest community, soon to be demolished. <br />

      <br />The three-piece band wailed on a cover of “Voodoo Child,” the electric guitar solo wafting out from the poolside courtyard, past the shuttered restaurant and bar that decades ago was a community watering hole, and onto Neptune Marina’s 136 townhome units. Many of them sat empty for the first time in more than 50 years.
      One of the landlord’s employees sat within earshot in the nearby leasing office, but the band was never told to keep it down. Sheriff’s deputies didn’t bother stopping by. At the very least, the music was a reprieve from the jackhammering and other construction noise emanating from nearby projects along Admiralty Way on most days.

      <br /> <br /> The scene could have been mistaken for an evening during Neptune’s heyday decades ago, except for the forebodingly empty poolside units that had been vacated ahead of the development’s Aug. 26 eviction date. Some past residents chatted about whether to break into their old places for a last look around before demolition. A few tagged their former front doors with magic marker.

      <br /> <br /> Revelers relived the glory days of past parties and revisited the romances and mundanities of decades gone by. A few who’d spent their 20s and 30s here called it the “Melrose Place” of the marina. One said she’d moved in and out of Neptune six times. Another said his former roommate had met his wife at a party around the very same pool.

      Some pondered why Neptune long stood out among the marina’s numerous apartment buildings — all of which were newer, taller and, one could easily argue, nicer. The general consensus was that Neptune still had a community feel at a time when neighborly communication had disappeared elsewhere or moved online. <a href="http://argonautnews.com/the-partys-over-at-neptune-marina/">

      <h4>Pregnant Women, Newborns On Front Lines Of Arizona Opioid Epidemic</h4>
      LOS ANGELES, Calif. -- When Jessica Sanchez tested positive last year for heroin, her probation officer sent her to an Arizona detox center for treatment. But before Sanchez could be admitted, she needed to take a pregnancy test.

      <br /> <br />That’s how Sanchez, 25, discovered she was expecting her first child. She was four and-a-half months pregnant and had been abusing heroin for four years, following two years of opioid pain pill abuse.

      <br /><br />The surprise pregnancy gave Sanchez a deep desire to get clean.

      <br /><br />“I had a reason to live,” she said. “[Before], I didn’t feel like life was worth living because I had no reason to get clean.”

      <br /><br />But she would soon learn the challenges pregnant women face when they seek drug treatment. The detox center, for example, turned her away, since its cold-turkey approach would put the baby’s life at risk. <a href="https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/analysis/pregnant-women-newborns-on-front-lines-of-arizonas-opioid-epidemic/26572">
